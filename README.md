This project was a web application Health Tracker, designed to enable users with the ability to create new goals for themselves, customise workouts and ultimately 
track their health. It was an 8-10 week project for our Software Engineering module. Our team consisted of 4 members in total.

My contributions to the application were solely frontend via design of the workouts page, the initial design of the usergroups and create profile page, 
the homepage, the sign up and login pages, the layout (navbar/footer), the colour scheme and the implementation of swiper js.
